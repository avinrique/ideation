Your observation that innovation will become more critical as software development becomes easier is insightful and aligns with historical trends in technology. Let's unpack this, weigh the evidence, and assess whether your platform addresses a genuine need.

What the Trends and Stats Suggest
Software Development Simplification

Tools like low-code/no-code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Webflow) and AI-assisted coding tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) are making software creation more accessible.
Stat: The global low-code development market is projected to grow from $16.3 billion in 2023 to $148.5 billion by 2030, showing a shift toward democratizing software creation.
Implication: The barrier to creating software will reduce, but creativity and innovation in software ideas will remain scarce and valuable.
Innovation as a Bottleneck

Stat: A study by McKinsey (2023) revealed that 84% of executives believe innovation is crucial for their business strategy, yet only 6% are satisfied with their innovation performance.
Innovation is inherently human-centric, relying on diverse perspectives, deep domain knowledge, and creative ideation—all areas where AI and tools can assist but not replace humans fully.
Implication: Platforms that genuinely foster collaboration and innovation, especially across diverse domains, will address a real pain point.
The Problem with Existing Platforms

Current tools (Slack, Miro, Notion, etc.) are primarily focused on execution and collaboration but don’t explicitly prioritize structured innovation.
Few platforms incentivize brainstorming effectively or protect intellectual property (e.g., sharing innovative ideas openly risks misuse).
Implication: A platform that structures ideation, tracks contributions, and connects users meaningfully could fill a gap.
Blockchain and AI Hype vs. Reality

While blockchain and AI are buzzwords, not all applications are practical or widely adopted yet. Adoption often lags due to complexity, cost, and unclear user value.
Stat: Gartner’s 2023 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies shows blockchain plateauing, while AI applications like generative AI are nearing mainstream adoption.
Implication: Your idea needs to carefully justify blockchain's necessity and focus on delivering clear value to users.
What Could Work
Structured Ideation

Offering a tool that organizes and enhances the creative process could appeal to teams struggling to innovate.
AI's role in assisting brainstorming and connecting experts to complement users' gaps is promising.
IP Protection

Blockchain for tracking contributions and ownership adds value, especially in competitive industries like research and product development.
Networking for Innovation

Connecting individuals based on their ideation patterns and areas of expertise could be a game-changer, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.
What Might Not Work
Overcomplication

If the platform feels too complex (blockchain wallets, token systems, AI integration), it could alienate users, especially those who want simplicity.
Misaligned Incentives

Tokenization or gamification might unintentionally reward shallow or spammy contributions rather than meaningful ideas.
Adoption Hurdle

Without an established user base or integration with existing tools, convincing people to switch might be a slow, uphill battle.
Overreliance on Technology

While AI and blockchain are powerful, innovation thrives on human creativity, which tools can only augment, not replace.
My Take
Your platform has potential, but execution will be everything. For it to work:

Simplify the MVP: Focus on one core problem, such as structured ideation with blockchain-based IP tracking. Test with early adopters.
Prove Value Early: Show how your platform uniquely enhances innovation compared to existing tools. Demonstrate use cases where it saved time, generated valuable insights, or resolved IP disputes.
Human-Centric Design: Ensure the platform empowers users to think creatively, without making technology feel like a barrier.
Flexibility: Offer modular features so users can adopt what they need (e.g., ideation, networking, or IP protection).
Will It Work?
Yes, if:

You solve a clear pain point and make the platform intuitive.
You target the right audience, such as startups, corporate R&D teams, or academic researchers.
You prioritize human collaboration, with technology as a facilitator.
No, if:

The platform feels like "tech for tech's sake" without clear user benefits.
It’s overcomplicated, with high entry barriers like blockchain wallets or token systems.
You fail to attract early adopters or show measurable success.
Conclusion
Your belief that innovation will be the primary bottleneck in the future is valid, and your platform addresses a real need. However, success will depend on balancing simplicity, value, and scalability. With the right focus and execution, this idea could work and potentially thrive in a world where creativity is at a premium.
